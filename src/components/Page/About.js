        <i className="fas fa-user-circle mx-2"></i>My Name is Christian Dorner (Preferably Chris). I grew up on a homestead 30 miles from the closest small town and have always
        loved electronics. Upon moving out and getting a job i realized i didn't want to continue the cycle of living on a homestead like
        my family. Instead i show a talent for taking apart and fixing small electronic, this lead me to have an interest in coding.
        when i started to watch vidoes on how to code i quickly realized that, while teaching myself was possible, it would be extremely difficult.
        This then lead me to take a bootcamp course at UofA, in this bootcamp we progressed rapidly and learned many coding languages.
        For example: Html, Css, Javascript, React, mysql, noSql (specifically MongoDB), and many more. In the process of taking this course
        I feel as though i have learned many desirable coding languages and practices, making me a shoo in for most positions in a coding enviroment.
